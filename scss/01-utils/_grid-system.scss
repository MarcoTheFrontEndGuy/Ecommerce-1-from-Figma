// VS CODE EXTENSION TO COMPILE SASS IS GIVING ME PROBLEMS TO WORK WITH CSS GRID 
// I DECIDED TO USE "SOME CSS GRID", BUT MOST OF THE TIME I USED CSS FLEXBOX 

// THE POINT FOR ME WAS: 

// 1. Open Figma design 
// 2. Add grid on top 
// 3. Create some kind of bootstrap grid myself ("only the good part");
